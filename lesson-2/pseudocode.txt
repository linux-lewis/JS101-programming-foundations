Problem 1: a function that returns the sum of two numbers 

Given two numbers.

Add the two numbers and return the output


START

# Given two integers called "num1" and "num2"

SET output = num1 + num2

PRINT output

END



Problem 2: a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given a collection of strings

concatenate each string together

return concatenated string


START

# Given a collection of strings called "strings"

SET newString = READ strings and concatenate

END


Problem 3: a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Given a collection of numbers called numbers

Create a new variable as an empty array

Iterate through the collection one by one
  -for each iteration, add the value to the new array
  -increment the loop in steps of 2 to only add every other value

After iterating through the collection, return the new array


START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET newArray = empty array ([])
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  push value within numbers collection at space "iterator" to "newArray"

  iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT newArray

END
